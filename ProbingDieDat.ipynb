    "# Probing for Dutch Relative Pronoun Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Delobelle et al. 2020 test RobBERT, a Dutch language model using the Roberta architecture and training objective, with a task where the model has to predict *die* or *dat*. This is a so-called masked prediction task, where one word in a sentence is replaced with the special token [MASK] and the model has to predict which of two possible words (*die* or *dat*) is more likely in the position of the mask. Neural language models take the full context into account to make the prediction. Delobelle collect data from the Dutch section of the Europarl corpus, where they use all sentences containing die or dat as test cases (288K sentences). The task is inspired by a similar experiment from Allein et al. 2020. Allein et al use data from Europarl and Sonar to train a neural classifier for the task, using an LSTM that is initialized with word embeddings obtained from a word2vec model. They obtain accuracies of 83.2% (Europarl) and 84.5% (Sonar). (Majority baseline is 66% for Europarl as reported by Delobelle). \n",
    "\n",
    "Delobelle report very high levels of accuracy for RobBERT and for Bertje as well as mBERT(98.2-99.2% for all models). It should be noted though that in many cases, there is no real ambiguity, as (1) *dat* is used as subordinator not as pronoun, (2) *die* or *dat* is used but there are no preceding nouns with the opposite gender. Also, in cases where *die* or *dat* is used as deictic pronoun introducing an NP (*die jongen*), the noun with which the pronoun agrees is usually adjacent or very close to the pronoun (with no intervening distractors), making the task superficially easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We turn the task into a proper probing task, and make the task harder, by zooming in on cases where \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the masked position is a relative pronoun, \n",
    "2. the relative pronoun ia part of  a complex NP of the form *...noun1 ... van ... noun2 ...RelClause* where the two nouns are of opposite gender and the relative clause is attached to either to the higher noun1 (the less likely configuration in Dutch) or the lower noun2\n",
    "\n",
    "Both nouns have to be singular, as plural nouns always take *die* as relative pronoun. In these cases, predicting the correct relative pronoun amounts to recognizing that the mask introduces a relative clause that has been attached to either the higher or lower noun. In this way, we can use pronoun choice to probe the ability of the model to be sensitive to relative clause attachment, eventhough the language model itself only predicts the likelihood of strings, not of structures. It should be noted though, that in contrast with subject-verb agreement, right context potentially plays a role in the prediction, as some relative clauses might be more likely to be introduced by a die/dat relative pronoun (which often has the role of subject in the relative clause) than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dutch has a gender system, where singular nouns are either neuter or nonneuter. The distinction is relevant for choice of the definite determiner (het or de), inflection of prenominal adjectives in indefinite NPs, and relative pronoun choice (die or dat). Here we are interested in the latter phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the model prefers die over dat, it has a preference for the most frequent pronoun, which overrides context\n",
    "2. If the model does better on low-attachment cases over high-attachment cases, it shows that it takes local context into account, but does not fully take into account the wider context.\n",
    "3. If the model does better on low-attachment cases over high-attachment cases, it shows that it takes preceding context into account, and not only following context. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative Clause Attachment \n",
    "\n",
    "Relative clause attachment has been studied extensively from a psycholinguistic perspective (see Desmet for a study on Dutch). The canonical example is \n",
    "\n",
    "> Someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Here, the relative clause could be attached either to the higher NP (the servant) or the lower NP (the actress). It has been claimed that languages differ in their preference for high or low attachment. Desmet et al write: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Probably the most interesting finding about the syntactic ambiguity in (1) is that the preferred interpretation differs across languages, with English preferring low attachment, and many other languages (Dutch, French, German, Spanish) preferring high attachment (for an overview, see Mitchell & Brysbaert, 1998). In line with the tuning hypothesis, evidence has been obtained that in English text corpora low attachment is more prevalent than high attachment, whereas in Spanish and French the reverse pattern was found (Baltazart & Kister, 1995; Corley, 1996; Cuetos et al., 1996; Mitchell & Brysbaert, 1998; Mitchell et al., 1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "Desmet et al point out that the earlier observed preference for high-attachment in fact does not exist if one takes into account the fact that Dutch has a gender system, disambiguating many of the potentially ambiguous cases. [CHECK]. In our newspaper data we also find that, in ambiguous as well as non-ambiguous contexts, low-attachment is far more frequent than high attachment. In this experiment, we use this ambiguity in combination with the fact that Dutch relative pronouns agree with the gender of the antecedent, to design a probing task for neural language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "We search the newspaper section of the SONAR/LAssyLarge corpus for relevant examples, using the automatically parsed data of the LassyLarge corpus (Van Noord et al, 20xx). We use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    '//node[@cat=\"np\" and node[@pos=\"noun\" and @gen=\"het\" and @num=\"sg\"] \n",
    "                      and node[@rel=\"mod\" and @cat=\"pp\" and node[@rel=\"hd\" and @root=\"van\"]]/\n",
    "                            node[@cat=\"np\" and node[@pos=\"noun\" and @gen=\"de\" and @num=\"sg\"]]]/\n",
    "          node[@rel=\"mod\" and @cat=\"rel\"]/node[@rel=\"rhd\" and @word=\"dat\"]'\n",
    "\n",
    "This query searches for an NP containing a het-noun as head, a PP containing an NP with a de-noun as head, and finally a relative introduced by 'dat'. Note that the fact that the relative clause is an immediate daughter of the highest node with category NP means that the relative clause is attached to the higher noun. A similar query is used for the *die*-cases (with oppositve gender specifications). \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of our data is: \n",
    "\n",
    ">  Melk is het enige product van de koe [MASK] aan de paniek is ontsnapt .\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the correct choice is *dat*, as the relative clause modifies the neuter noun *product* and not the nonneuter noun *koe*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that is some cases, the masked sentence actually is ambiguous, in the sense that both the choice for dat and the choice for die result in a sentence with a plausible interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Een dagboek van de nieuwe NCMV-topman [MASK] een tip oplicht van de geheimen van de onderhandeling .\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the choice for *dat* amounts to choosing *dagboek* as antecedent (in line with the source) whereas die amounts to choosing *NCMW-topman* as antecedent, a possibility that would result in a semantically plausible sentence as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "False hits in the corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Het gevaar van een hernieuwde oorlog komt uit Rusland zelf , [MASK] in het verleden nooit lang bij de zijlijn is blijven staan in de Kaukasus .\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the correct antecedent is *Rusland* and not *gevaar* as the automatic parse assumes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguous cases were kept, false hits (wrong attachments, dat as subordinating conjuction) were removed. Duplicate sentences were also removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Attachment statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Desmet et al cite the psycholinguistic literature as claiming that Dutch generally has a preference for high attachment. The raw frequencies in our corpus contradict this view. (see discussion with Kisjes). SO we assume that high attachment cases are actually more challenging to the model, as in those cases the antecedent is separated from the pronoun by a distractor with opposite gender, and the corpus frequencies do not favor high attachment per se. \n",
